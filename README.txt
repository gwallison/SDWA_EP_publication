These two files are the final versions of the Jupyter notebooks used in the analysis, 
graphing and table assembly for the article: Underhill, V. et al., 
"Outcomes of the Halliburton Loophole: Chemicals Regulated by the 
Safe Drinking Water Act in US Fracking Disclosures, 2014-2021." Environmental Pollution.

The data used are available in the CodeOcean Open-FF project, v.14:
https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.1058811.v14

Note that these notebooks are not directly executable without some support code and an environment that
facilitates these programs.  Nevertheless, we provide these notebooks to document all of the 
data preparation, analysis and graphing we performed.
